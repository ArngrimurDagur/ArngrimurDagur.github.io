                        <h1>The Development of CS : GO</h1>
                        <p>The development of CSGO started in March 2010, eleven years after the release of the original Counter-strike. Valve saw the need to expand Counter-Strike’s gameplay when Hidden Path Entertainment tried to port the game into consoles.
                        </p>
                        <p>The original version was somehow outdated since gamers had better tools to run complex games with more features. The idea was to reinvent the FTP to meet the needs of the fast-growing fan base. In August 2011, Jess Cliffe, one of the developers, announced on Stream Forums that they were developing "Global Offensive", a new version of Counter-Strike.
                        </p>
			<h1>COUNTER-STRIKE BEFORE CSGO</h1>
			<p>Counter-Strike was developed by Jess Cliffe and Minh Le, who released the game's beta version in 1999. The multiplayer game drew more attention in 2000 when Valve bought the game’s intellectual property. In September of the same year, the company released the first non-beta version of the game for PCs.</p>
			<p>As the game gained more popularity, some individuals started forming organized gaming teams, which led to the dawn of eSports. The 2001 Cyberathlete Championship was the first significant eSports competition for Counter-Strike (won by the legendary Ninjas in Pyjamas).</p>

                        <h1>Ninjas In Pyjamas</h1>
                        <p>Ninjas in Pyjamas (often abbreviated to NIP and NiP) is a Swedish esports organization founded in 2000. The team competed in Counter-Strike until their dissolution in 2007. In 2012, the team returned with a now heavily renowned Counter-Strike: Global Offensive squad. The squad was revamped following the departure of longtime duo Christopher "GeT_RiGhT" Alesund and Patrik "f0rest" Lindberg after the end of the StarLadder Berlin Major and the re-signing of Björn "THREAT" Pers as head coach, who redirected the organization's resources into acquiring prominent young talent such as AWPer Tim "nawwk" Jonasson and in-game leader Hampus "hampus" Poser. On April 23, 2021, Nicolai "dev1ce" Reedtz was acquired from Astralis in a historic transfer as a replacement for the former.
